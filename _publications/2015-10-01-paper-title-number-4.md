collection: publications
excerpt: 'This study focuses on automating the identification and classification of tidal marsh communities in coastal Virginia, USA, using a deep learning segmentation model. Leveraging features learned from data-rich regions and a combination of Sentinel-2 and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery, the research achieves a high classification accuracy of up to 88% for marsh types, specifically high and low marshes, at a spatial resolution of 0.6 meters.'

Coastal wetlands, especially tidal marshes, play a crucial role in supporting ecosystems and slowing shoreline erosion. Accurate and cost-effective identification and classification of various marsh types, such as high and low marshes, are important for effective coastal management and conservation endeavors. However, mapping tidal marshes is challenging due to heterogeneous coastal vegetation and dynamic tidal influences. In this study, we employ a deep learning segmentation model to automate the identification and classification of tidal marsh communities in coastal Virginia, USA using seasonal, publicly available satellite and aerial images. This research leverages the combined capabilities of Sentinel-2 and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery and a UNet architecture to accurately classify tidal marsh communities. We illustrate that by leveraging features learned from data abundant regions and small quantities of high-quality training data collected from the target region, an accuracy as high as 88% can be achieved in the classification of marsh types, specifically high marsh and low marsh, at a spatial resolution of 0.6 meters. This research contributes to the field of marsh mapping by highlighting the potential of combining multispectral satellite imagery and deep learning for accurate and efficient marsh type classification.
