excerpt: '
This research explores the application of advanced machine learning techniques, such as a supervised convolutional neural network and semi-supervised clustering, to accurately estimate population density, median household income, and educational attainment from high-resolution aerial imagery of various U.S. cities. The findings reveal that the developed models successfully capture neighborhood density, with the supervised approach demonstrating notable explanatory power in predicting population income and education levels. This work lays a foundation for further geographic generalization and presents a novel semi-supervised approach for extracting fine-scale information from aerial imagery without the need for extensive labeled data.'

Many areas of the world are without basic information on the socioeconomic well-being of the residing population due to limitations in existing data collection methods. Overhead
images obtained remotely, such as from satellite or aircraft, can help serve as windows into the state of life on the ground
and help “fill in the gaps” where community information is
sparse, with estimates at smaller geographic scales requiring
higher resolution sensors. Concurrent with improved sensor resolutions, recent advancements in machine learning and computer
vision have made it possible to quickly extract features from
and detect patterns in image data, in the process correlating
these features with other information. In this work, we explore
how well two approaches—a supervised convolutional neural
network and semi-supervised clustering based on bag-of-visualwords—estimate population density, median household income,
and educational attainment of individual neighborhoods from
publicly available high-resolution imagery of cities throughout
the United States. Results and analyses indicate that features
extracted from the imagery can accurately estimate the density
(R2 up to 0.81) of neighborhoods, with the supervised approach
able to explain about half the variation in a population’s income
and education. In addition to the presented approaches serving
as a basis for further geographic generalization, the novel semisupervised approach provides a foundation for future work
seeking to estimate fine-scale information from aerial imagery
without the need for label data.
