permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This research investigates the utility of deep learning for mapping shoreline armoring structures, emphasizing computationally efficient methods for semi-automated delineation using high-resolution imagery. The ResNet18-based Pyramid Attention Network (PAN) architecture demonstrated a 72% overall accuracy, with notable precision of 80% and 94% for breakwaters and groins, respectively. This lightweight implementation enables swift processing of 1.5 kilometers of shoreline in 1.4 seconds (GPU) to 2.16 seconds (CPU) within simulated user environments. The study also introduces pyShore, providing a deep learning algorithm for human coders to incorporate into a semi-automated workflow.'
