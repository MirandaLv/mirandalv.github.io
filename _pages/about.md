About me
======
I am a dedicated Research Scientist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, specializing in the application of machine learning and high-resolution satellite imagery for coastal resource management (geoAI). My expertise lies in designing and developing open-source tools to (1) automate the extraction and classification of [shoreline stabilization structures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009830042200245X), (2) map coastal vegetation, and (3) predict nearshore bathymetry from satellite imagery. In addition to coastal research, I am actively involved in leveraging deep learning and remote sensing imagery to estimate [environmental, social, and economic well-being](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16808) in developing countries. I am in the final year of my PhD program (grad ~May 2024) under the guidance of Prof. [Dan Runfola](https://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/people/runfola_d.php) at [geoLab](https://sites.google.com/view/wmgeolab/) at William & Mary.
