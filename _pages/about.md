About me
======
I am a Research Scientist and Senior Geospatial Researcher at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, specializing in the application of machine learning and high-resolution satellite imagery for coastal resource management (geoAI). My expertise lies in designing and developing open-source tools to (1) automate the extraction and classification of shoreline stabilization structures, (2) map coastal vegetation, and (3) predict nearshore bathymetry from satellite imagery. In addition to coastal research, I am actively involved in leveraging deep learning and remote sensing imagery to estimate environmental, social, and economic well-being in developing countries. I am in the final year of my PhD program (grad ~May 2024) under the guidance of Prof. [Dan Runfola](https://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/people/runfola_d.php) at [geoLab](https://sites.google.com/view/wmgeolab/) at William & Mary.
