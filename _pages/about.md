About me
======
I am a dedicated Research Scientist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, specializing in the application of cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques with high-resolution satellite imagery for coastal resource management. My expertise lies in designing and developing open-source [tools](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009830042200245X) to automate the extraction and classification of shoreline stabilization structures, map coastal vegetation, and predict nearshore bathymetry from satellite imagery. In addition to my work in coastal research, I am actively involved in leveraging deep learning and remote sensing imagery to contribute towards predicting [environmental, social, and economic well-being](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16808) in developing countries. Currently in the final year of my Ph.D. program, I am conducting impactful research under the guidance of Prof. [Dan Runfola](https://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/people/runfola_d.php) at [geoLab](https://sites.google.com/view/wmgeolab/), College of William and Mary.
