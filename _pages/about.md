About me
======
I am a dedicated Research Scientist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, specializing in the application of cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques with high-resolution satellite imagery for coastal resource management. My expertise lies in designing and developing open-source [tools](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009830042200245X) to automate the extraction and classification of shoreline stabilization structures, map coastal vegetation, and predict nearshore bathymetry from satellite imagery. In addition to my work in coastal research, I am actively involved in leveraging deep learning and remote sensing imagery to contribute towards predicting [environmental, social, and economic well-being](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16808) in developing countries. Currently in the final year of my Ph.D. program, I am conducting impactful research under the guidance of Prof. [Dan Runfola](https://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/people/runfola_d.php) at [geoLab](https://sites.google.com/view/wmgeolab/), College of William and Mary.

[comment]: <> (Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file &#40;like [this one]&#40;https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md&#41; and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview &#40;to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons&#41;. You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. )
